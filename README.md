## [Lit](https://kongsally.github.io/LIT/) : A virtual lighting lab to design and preview stagelights

###Inspiration
Lighting sets an appropriate atmosphere and heightens an audience's understanding of a theatrical performance. However, rehearsing and experimenting with lighting is costly and time consuming. That is why we made a virtual lighting lab that is more accessible and fun to play with! :)
###What it does
There are two major components for LIT.

1) Lit provides a real-time rendering of the stage to the user in response to any change made to light's color, intensity, and the camera perspective.The user can toggle light helpers. The spotlight palette is pre-populated with [LEE's filter colors](http://www.leefilters.com/lighting/colour-list.html) for users to experiment with, and they may also save the cue configuration and download the scene's images for future reference. The user can zoom by scrolling, rotate by dragging, and pan by holding middle mouse button and dragging.

2) The Lit VR Viewer puts users in the stages they designed. It uses device orientation so users can use a cardboard to look around the stage. By saying "cue," users can transition to a scene with different lighting and perspective.
